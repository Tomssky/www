        <h2>Some Stuff About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a young, motivated and inspired student, but sometimes the world can get to me in many different ways. Even though sometimes the world looks bleak and gray, I try to be positive and bright!
            There are many things that help me get through my hardships, <br>
        </p>
        <h1>Here are some examples!</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Listening to music to lift my mood</li>
            <li>Spending time in nature to recharge</li>
            <li>Talking with friends for support</li>
            <li>Engaging in creative activities like drawing and design</li>
            <li>Practicing mindfulness and meditation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            these are a few things that really help me calm down in though times. Some people would say that these things are "basic" and "don't really help you", 
            but i say that they are just pessimistic and are trying to pull me down into the slumps with them.
        </p>
        <h1> Also can't forget about my biggest helper! My Cat named Lusis!</h1>
