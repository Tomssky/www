                <h2>Model</h2>
                <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a detailed model and its layout using simple, 
                    lightweight materials to showcase the design in a clear and effective way. 
                    After considering various options, I decided to focus on building a model house set in a 
                    picturesque location near the shore, with a rocky hillside as a backdrop. 
                    The combination of the tranquil shoreline and the rugged terrain would allow me to explore contrasts 
                    in natural elements while adding visual interest to the design.
                    By using lightweight materials such as foam, cardboard, and wire, 
                    I was able to craft a realistic representation of the landscape, 
                    while also ensuring that the model would be easy to handle and transport. 
                    The goal was to create a compelling scene that captured the essence of coastal living, 
                    with the rocky hillside providing a dramatic and natural contrast to the peaceful, 
                    open space by the water.</p>
