                <h2>Starry night bus stop</h2>
                <p>This project involved designing a bus stop that was not only visually unique and exciting but also practical for everyday use. 
                    We wanted to create something that would stand out in the urban landscape while still fulfilling the fundamental 
                    purpose of providing a comfortable and functional waiting area for commuters. 
                    Our goal was to incorporate innovative design elements that could capture attention, 
                    while ensuring the structure remained easy to maintain and durable over time. 
                    We carefully considered factors such as accessibility, weather resistance, and user comfort, 
                    making sure that the final design would not only be aesthetically pleasing but also practical 
                    and efficient for long-term upkeep. The project required a balance between creativity and practicality, 
                    ensuring that the bus stop would enhance the travel experience without becoming a burden in terms of construction 
                    or maintenance in the months ahead.</p>
